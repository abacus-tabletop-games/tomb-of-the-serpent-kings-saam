This is the famed "learning" module in an old school style. 

It is released as a System-Agnostic Adventure Module (SAAM). This does not mean that the adventure itself is written to be played with any ruleset, only that it is built to be usable with any Foundry game system. This is a dream of mine: adventure modules being made without being locked to a specific system. I hope it will catch on, so that GMs can have access to lots of ready-to-play adventures while still retaining their ability to use the system they prefer.

It makes this module less dependent on software in the same way a PDF or a hard copie is: all the tools you already have can be used to play the adventure. The downside is that there are no Actors and no Items provided in this module, since those are not system-agnostic. You need to use the ones provided by your game system (or create your own). To mitigate this, 

*Tomb of the Serpent Kings* is the perfect candidate to start this. It's an old-school module meant to teach anyone how to play, whatever their ruleset of choice. It is shared under a CC-BY-NC-SA license, meaning it's free to use, reuse and adapt as long as the result remains free, too (and attribution given). It is also widely shared as a great way to start playing in an old-school way. Hopefully, this module will make it almost as easy to do so using Foundry as it is using a physical tabletop.
